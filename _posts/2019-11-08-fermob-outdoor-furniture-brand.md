As the mercury rises, we are drawn outside into the fresh air, allowing the sun’s rays to warm us from the outside in. Together with Fermob, France’s leading outdoor furniture brand, we explore the limitless possibilities and combinations available to transform your outdoor spaces.

<h4><b>Joie de vivre</b></h4>
At the core of their brand is the uniquely French mantra of ‘joie de vivre’ that underpins every decision. Joie de vivre directly translates to ‘joy of living’. From design and development to the final product and vast array of 24 different finishing colours, joy can be found in each piece for furniture, and the processes along the way.

As a company, Fermob is always looking to innovate, expand and spread their love for well made French outdoor furniture, and the happiness and memories created by their users. The brand wants you to have a piece of France in your home, and to allow you to experience the extreme happiness that outdoor spaces can bring. Its end user is not just buying a product, but being exposed to this uniquely French feeling.

<h4><b>Fermob People</b></h4>
This French lifestyle is evident in the Femob Family Album, released once a year to celebrate and highlight #FermobPeople. Put simply, the album is about a bunch of cool people in their cool world, surrounded by Fermob. Not limited just to France, the casting call for this album is world wide. Featuring real people, selected for their originality, to represent the Fermob community, we are happy to be a part of it and spread the je ne sais quoi that makes <b>Fermob</b> so special.

<h4><b>History<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></h4>
The company began in 1889, (officially founded as “Fermob” in 1977) with a single design, the Bistro Chair. Designed by Edouard Leclerc, the light weight, folding chair was quickly adopted along the banks of the Seine River and on the terrace of many French Bistro Cafes. The simple design and flexibility allowed businesses to quickly bring them out when the weather allowed, and pack them back when necessary. This iconic piece exemplifies the advancement of French metal work in the 19th Century. The year it was introduced also marks the completion of the Eiffel Tower. Since its inception, the design has hardly changed, but continues to evolve with advancements in technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

<h4><b>Life Outside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></h4>
You will find Fermob's outdoor furniture in some of the most highly trafficked areas around the world – Times Square in New York, The Forbidden City in Beijing and the Jardin du Luxembourg in Paris. The furniture is both subtle and robust, enabling inclusion across a wide range of contexts. Specific pieces have been designed for large scale public urban environments, with shared spaces in multi-residential domestic use in mind.

Fermob’s constant drive for innovation has lead to collaborations with manufacturer Serge Ferrari to create their latest outdoor technical fabric (OTF). The latest OTF, Stereo, is the result of 2 years of R&amp;D by both companies, with a stunning 3D effect created by the multi coloured 5 thread weave. Its aesthetic qualities are rivalled only by its functionality. Easy to clean and resistant to stains, UV rays and tars, this colourfast fabric is also extremely comfortable. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Their constant innovation can also been seen in the unique 24 hue colour story. Constantly evolving and developed from scratch, Fermob’s polyester paint pigments undergo a comprehensive series of tests for baking, hardness, resistance to scratches and corrosion. All powder paints are applied in their own zero-waste facility, so Fermob has complete control over the quality and a clear environmental conscience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<h4><b>Get Inspired<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></h4>
Bring joie de vivre into your garden in time for summer, knowing that you are investing in hard-wearing eco friendly outdoor furniture. The colour combinations are simply endless, allowing you to show your personality. Go for a monochrome palate, contrasting tones, an ombre look, or choose a neutral base and add pops of colour through side tables, chairs or accessories.

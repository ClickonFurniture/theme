<h4 style="text-align: center;">It’s hard to believe that we are already in June but when you take a minute to look back on what has happened, we have been able to squeeze a lot into the past six months at Clickon.</h4>
<a href="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/key-great-brunch-clickon-furniture-x-ethnicraft"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1302 size-large" src="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/newsletter1-1024x953.jpg" alt="Clickon Team Photo" width="809" height="753" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our biggest achievement was the opening of our fifth showroom in St Kilda in February, which we celebrated with our valued and newly found customers over three exciting days. Our boutique St Kilda Showroom is the first to showcase a monthly brand feature window.  This has really allowed our customers to understand and immerse themselves in a particular brand's style, allowing our customers to easily picture the pieces working in their homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/brand/eno-studio"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1303 size-large" src="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/enostudio-1024x762.jpg" alt="Eno Studio " width="809" height="602" /></a>St Kilda, as part of their feature window, was the first of our showrooms to display our fabulous new brand ENO Studio. ENO Studio is a French furniture and accessories brand who partners with designers from around the world to produce functional yet quirky products. An Australian exclusive to Clickon Furniture, ENO Studio has been met with great reception and we are excited to support the brand as it grows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/brand/harto"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1304" src="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harto-1024x762.jpg" alt="Harto Images" width="809" height="602" /></a>Hartô Paris, another Clickon exclusive, have brought out their new Marius storage range and enviable dining setting consisting of the Helene Extendable Dining Table, Hector Bench and Paula Chair.</p>
<a href="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/our-interview-with-jonathan-from-ethnicraft"><img class="alignleft wp-image-961" src="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-21-at-4.19.19-pm-1-1024x576.png" alt="Ethnicraft Interview" width="393" height="221" /></a>Our six-year long relationship with Ethnicraft continued to flourish with Jonathan Roelandts, the Sales Director of Ethnicraft Asia, speaking exclusively with our Showroom Operations Manager, Harrison, on his favourite products and must have items from the Ethnicraft range. Ethnicraft has also introduced some new items to their range this year, the most popular being the Mikado and Bok dining tables. With more products arriving later this year, including the much anticipated Whitebird range, be sure to keep an eye out for their other new products to come.

<a href="http://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/catalogsearch/result/?q=carson"><img class="alignright wp-image-1305" src="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FullSizeRender-4-1024x827.jpg" alt="Carson Coffee Table" width="411" height="332" /></a>

Our product design team has also been hard at work liaising with our manufacturers to produce some great additions to our own signature range. Carson Coffee Table, side table and console along with the Celine Sofa and Coco lounge chair have been so popular; effortlessly adding a luxe touch to your lounge room. It has been hard to keep them in stock!
<p style="text-align: center;">The new Oscar collection recently featured on the <a href="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/trend-forecast-marble-oscar-range?mc_cid=666d899a03&amp;mc_eid=[UNIQID]" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clickon Blog</a>, has also been hugely popular. While for the dining room, the Roden Dining Chair, Seth Leather Dining Chair and Connie Side Chair have been the clear favourites with our customers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Lastly, but not least, we presented our latest capsule collection <em>Transition Into Spring</em>.  Photographed by Dan Smith from Lampoluce, styled by Catherine Hucker at the Clickon Furniture team, the shoot encapsulates the transition from Winter into Spring through the use of small bursts of colour paired with muted hues, subtle contrasts and the odd injection of botanical silhouettes. This shoot conceded with the release of  Antionette Ferwerda’s two limited edition prints exclusive to Clickon Furniture. Stellar, and Nebular focus on luminosity and geometry complement the new additions which explore our human connection with the stars. Available in a limited print run of only 20 per piece be sure to order now to avoid disappointment.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Six months down still means there is six months to go and we have plenty more in store including a collaboration with a well known stylist.</h4>

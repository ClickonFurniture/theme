<p style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">A sofa can be a big investment, but choosing the right one the first time will ensure you love it for years to come. If you find you have been searching for too long without finding the perfect piece, a custom designed sofa is much simpler process then what you might think. You can become your own designer with ease using these three simple steps. </span></p>

<h4><em><span class="s1">Firstly, choose the style you like. </span></em></h4>
<span class="s1">What is going to work best in your home? That is something only you can answer, do you like something more firm and low maintenance or prefer a plush and cosy feather filled sofa. Would you like oak legs, brass legs, or something else. Picking the right style should be considered alongside how you use your space. Is it an occasional lounge space, or somewhere were the family spends most of it’s time, prompting yourself with these questions will help you get a better understanding of what you need. </span>

<h4><em><span class="s1">Select the modules that are going to be just right. </span></em></h4>
<span class="s1">Once you have picked the style that suits your space and your lifestyle, selecting the right size and shape sofa for your room is the next step. For all customisable sofas we have downloadable technical sheets on our website or in store. Our interior sales consultants are armed with the necessary tools to help you navigate the modules and make sure you are getting the most out of your space. </span>

<h4><span class="s1"><em>Add the finishing touch.</em> </span></h4>
<span class="s1">Selecting your fabric and its colour is the final step, as our different brands have different fabric ranges it is good to choose this last. Particular fabrics can also enhance the look and feel that you want to achieve in your living room such as lush velvets or soft linens. When you are deciding the fabric it is also important to factor in the furniture you currently have or are looking to purchase. The fully designed sofa will then become your blank canvas for throws and cushions to add extra textures and colours.

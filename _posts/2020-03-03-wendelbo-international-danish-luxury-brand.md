Embracing the new decade, multigenerational design house Wendelbo relaunches with a new visual style.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

<a href="https://blog.trithouse.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bureau-sofa-front1-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2300" src="https://blog.trithouse.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2019_11_18_Wendelbo_SMK61039.jpg" alt="Wendelbo Maho Sofa" width="1000" height="750" data-wp-pid="2300" /></a>

Wendelbo has nurtured Scandinavian craftsmanship traditions from their humble roots as a small furniture workshop across three generations, giving life to innovative and classic designs, set in a modern and contemporary context. From the very start, their goal has been to develop and produce furniture with a strong visual identity, optimal function and comfort Now an international brand, the Wendelbo collection is a modern selection of designs from a broad spectrum of international designers, culminating in a poised and elegant collection – all the while with an eye for the small details that make a big difference.

Wendelbo’s product palette is expressive and comprehensive and can be incorporated into any interior setting – whether it be a private home, where style, function and comfort are the focus – or in public settings, where the emphasis is on a strong and striking signature, an international expression and long-lasting solutions. With a keen sense of current trends and of life as it is lived at home, in the workplace or wherever people get together, Wendelbo offers characteristic furniture with a clear identity and effortless comfort.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CLICKON'S CURIO CANE CONSERVATORY</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of our most exciting product releases is the new range from Curio Cane. Displayed in our St Kilda Showroom as this month’s feature window is the Curio Cane Conservatory. The Conservatory brings to life the refined, sophisticated features of the rattan while celebrating the newly introduced shade of green. In the Conservatory, the old world meets new; our very own glasshouse bursting with an eclectic mix of tropical palms and ferns, green and gold accents and the ever-so-loved rattan.</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CANE FURNITURE THROUGHOUT HISTORY</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rattan furniture has always exuded a tropical feel into the interior and even more so with the painted green frame. Originating in South East Asia, the Rattan vine was first exported from Indonesia to China where craftsmen predominately weaved baskets for everyday use. European explorers returned with rattan items collected on their travels to South East Asia which created the perception of rattan to be something exotic. In the Victorian era the growing trend produced the ‘Peacock Chair’ and was favoured in furniture making due to its pliable nature and suitability in tropical climates. </span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>WHAT IS RATTAN?</b></span></h4>
<span class="s1">Rattan is produced from a vine closely related to the palm family. In essence it is the the inner core of the vine while Cane is the outer most layer of the same plant. This cane outer layer is combined with hardwood or metalwork to create a solid structure.</span>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CURIO'S MODERN INTERPRETATION </b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The clean, simple shapes used allow the materials to be the hero in Curio’s modern take on traditional rattan furniture. Perfect for bringing the outside in, the range will bring warmth to any interior this Spring and keep it there all year round. Designed as a complete collection, the pieces will work well with each other for maximum impact or can be used singly to create a stand out feature. The Cane Collection is sure to be the biggest trend of 2017 and with a choice between natural or painted timber frames there is a piece within the diverse range to suit any interior.</span></p>

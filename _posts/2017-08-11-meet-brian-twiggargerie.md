<p class="p1"><span style="color: #333399;"><span class="s1"><a href="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Brian-Twiggargerie-5-smaller-for-blog.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1415 alignright" src="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Brian-Twiggargerie-5-smaller-for-blog.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="481" data-wp-pid="1415" /></a><span style="color: #000080;">Brian firstly thank you for taking the time to come in today. Can you </span></span><span class="s2" style="color: #000080;">tell us a little about your professional background. What path led you to Twiggargerie?</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #000000;"><span class="s1">Well my professional background has been in Sales and Marketing, mostly in the aluminum industry for a large corporate company. Not really over</span><span class="s2">ly</span><span class="s1"> creative although I always loved doing practical things with my hands. The path into Twiggargerie was through helping out a friend who needed some creative pieces for a client. Due to time constraints as she was leaving the country in a week’s time, I stepped in and made some pieces and things grew from there. A contact from Julia Green at Greenhouse had taken the Twiggargerie brand places I would only have dreamt of!</span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #333399;">What a wonderful beginning to what is now a much-loved brand! </span><span class="s2"><span style="color: #333399;">How would you describe your work, what influences your pieces?</span>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love using natural wood as I get to meet some interesting people when I knock on their door and ask if I can walk through their orchard with my secateurs in hand, which is exactly what I did recently in Warrandyte.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Using natural wood also allows me freedom with the wood as no one expects the pieces to be perfect – this is natural wood after all and I try not to do much with it. The work itself is quite labor intensive ie each cube has 12 pieces that all need to be cut and then each piece is then drilled and glued to ensure their integrity! So an order for 12 cubes involves 144 cut pieces and 288 drill holes! But I still enjoy taking the pieces to their colourful finish. Colour is the best thing by far and I am fortunate to have some clever people around me in this area as my daughters think I am hopeless with colour – they are probably right!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #333399;"><span class="s1">How wonderful! </span><span class="s2">Can you give us a little insight into your creative process?</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #333399;"><span class="s2"><a href="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Brian-for-blog-2.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1429 alignright" src="http://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Brian-for-blog-2.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="245" data-wp-pid="1429" /></a></span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My most creative pieces are the cube sculptures and I love making them and never have too many set ideas of how they will look, but prefer to just let them flow. I have a desire to make a large sphere of cubes about 2 meters across – just need the space and the client to make it for! I never feel that I a</span><span class="s2"> m a</span><span class="s1"> creative person but sometimes I surprise myself!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #333399;"><span class="s1">Creativity takes all shapes and forms don’t they say? We will certainly keep our eye out for that amazing sphere.</span><span class="s2"> What are some resources that you go to when you’re in need of inspiration?</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am very lucky to have super clever and creative twin daughters who are always saying “Dad have you thought about making…………?”, plus knowing the crew from Greenhouse Interiors is a real bonus. Just keep the ideas coming, I say .</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #333399;"><span class="s1">What a powerful network! </span><span class="s2">You are a part of a very creative family. Tell us what that dynamic is like. Will there be a collaboration on it’s way?</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have twin daughters, Jemma and Phoebe who are fabulous <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(I am ever so slightly biased!) and I like to think I have a great relationship with both of them. Jemma has had a children’s book published, runs her own children’s bedding business, and lives in Jaipur in India. Jemma always finds a way to land on her feet. Phoebe started Sageandclare from scratch a few years ago and it is doing super well. She is becoming a very good business person, is very determined and has provided me with Jude my first Grandson. I am very proud of both of them. Its not that often we are all together these days but have a lot of fun when we are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mmm a collaboration is a good idea and as we are all together very soon, I shall raise it and see where it leads!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #333399;">Our latest custom pieces with Twiggergerie are dropping in Clickon stores soon. Tell us why these pieces we love so much work so well in so many spaces?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To be honest, I think their simplicity and the fact that they are natural is a big plus. I also have always tried to make them available to as many people as possible through my pricing approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have always tried to make sure people have an enjoyable experience when placing orders with me as I try to make it as easy as possible.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span style="color: #333399;"><span class="s1">We completely agree with you there – they are certainly a favourite in our showrooms and you as always are a pleasure to work with! </span><span class="s2">What’s next for Twiggargerie?</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I really want to do more creative sculptural pieces and maybe organize an exhibition at some point. Keep on dreaming, I say.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #333399;">Brian, thank you so much for your time today. What a wonderful insight! We will keep a keen eye out to see what is around the corner for yourself you’re your wonderful brand Twiggargerie. </span></p>

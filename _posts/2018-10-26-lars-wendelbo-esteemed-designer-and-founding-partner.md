<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wendelbo is a family owned and run business with deep roots in Scandinavian design aesthetics as well as traditional Danish craftsmanship. Their one of a kind pieces combine their history with modern practicality to produce furniture that meets the needs of today’s world. This multigenerational design house strives for the perfect balance between innovation and functionality. We sat down with Lars Wendelbo, founding partner and esteemed designer to learn more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Clickon Furniture:</b> How has 2018 been going so far for you and the company?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Lars Wendelbo: </b>The first half of 2018 we have been very busy, we have attended 3 Furniture Fairs in Europe and 1 in Asia and at the same time we have expanded our production premises.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CF:</b> Can you tell us a little bit more about how Wendelbo was first created.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>LW: </b>Wendelbo has roots dating back to 1955 where my father started a small workshop for manufacturing of custom-made sofas &amp; chairs. Our family has a long tradition for making upholstery so it more or less a matter of course that I should also go in this direction. The first years we were producing very classic designs but [we] continually developed the collection into modern contemporary design, which is how you know us today. But the process will continue...</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/brand/wendelbo/raft-sofa"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1989" src="https://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Raft-full-front-1024x610.jpg" alt="Wendelbo Raft Sofa" width="650" height="387" data-wp-pid="1989" /></a><span class="s1">The Raft Sofa by 365° North, an old favourite recaptured in new light.

&nbsp;
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CF:</b> Yes, the latest Wendelbo catalogue is absolutely stunning! I’m sure our customers would love to get the look at home, what are your tips on achieving the ultimate danish style? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>LW:</b> I can do that by quoting a famous designer “Less is more…”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CF:</b> Which product is your favourite piece? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>LW: </b>There are so many so it is very difficult to answer, but from our own collection The Visa Chair, designed by Anderssen &amp; Voll is my favourite.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CF:</b> And which out of your stunning sofa range do you have in your own lounge room? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>LW:</b> EDGE V2.</span></p>

&nbsp;
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CF:</b> The brand has grown rapidly in Australia and with it our relationship, did you ever predict this kind of success? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>LW: </b>Honestly no. The first [few] years our focus was on Scandinavia and later on, on Northern Europe but the last [couple of] years we have experienced a bigger and bigger interest for our designs from all over the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CF:</b> We first began our relationship in 2015 and it just continues to grow, how do you think the values and aesthetics of our two companies align?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>LW:</b> I find that Wendelbo and Clickon is a perfect match. Both are family run companies with a deep passion for design and craftsmanship.</span></p>

&nbsp;
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CF: </b>Have you ever considered branching further out into other furniture such as bedroom or dining furniture?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>LW:</b> Until now our focus has been on the living area but dining furniture could be an option in the future.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CF: </b>Are there any new product releases you can give us a sneak preview into? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>LW:</b> We have entered collaboration with some new international designers and have many new designs in the pipeline, but you will have to wait for the launch, early 2019. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>CF: </b>Yes, we certainly can’t wait to see what you bring next.</span></p>

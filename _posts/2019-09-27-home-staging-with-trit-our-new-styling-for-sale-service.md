First impressions count, and in this technology driven age, buyers are scouring online platforms when house-hunting. Making your digital impression is as important as the feeling the buyer gets when walking through your home for the first time. With so much competition in the market, it’s important for your online listing to stand out to potential buyers, as it will help draw them through the door.

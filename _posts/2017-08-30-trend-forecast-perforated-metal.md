<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Trend</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Metal has always been popular in furniture manufacturing because of it’s strength and durability. By perforating the metal it makes the material look weightless and beautiful. A contemporary look that you will soon start seeing everywhere.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Gabin Sideboard</strong></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">Following the very popular Marius Sideboard, French brand Harto have just introduced the second sideboard to their range, The Gabin. The Gabin’s perforated metal doors are inspired by the very popular trend, wicker. The juxtaposition of the metal and wood make these sideboards a real stand out. With well thought out storage, the perforated metal doors create a sense of mystery, a slight transparency so you can choose what you want to be seen and hidden and change that as you wish. The doors are available in Harto’s signature colours; Grey Blue, Light Grey, Pomelo Pink and Slate Grey and are sure to be a focal point in any home.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The Gabin is available in two different size options, 1620mm and 1220mm. The 1620mm sideboard comes in 2 styles, one has 3 drawers with brass handles. The drawers can be placed on either the right hand side or left hand side of the sideboard, making this piece highly versatile.</p>

Clickon Furniture have also just introduced a new product using perforated metal, The Puth TV Cabinets. Available in 2 size options, These TV Cabinets are as functional as they are beautiful. The perforated metal doors are not only aesthetically pleasing, they are a fantastic solution for a TV cabinet as the holes provide a gateway for the sensor between your remotes and consoles so they can be out of site yet still accessible.

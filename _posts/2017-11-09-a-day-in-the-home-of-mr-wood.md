<h4><strong>What is the favourite space in your home and why?</strong></h4>
I would have to say that my living room my favourite space in my home. It's where I spend most of my time, and full of great shared memories with my partner and our friends. It's also home to a good portion of our plant collection - there is nothing that makes me feel more relaxed than being surrounded by lush greenery.

<h4><strong>With so many beautiful pieces around you each day at work how did you decide on the items for your home? </strong></h4>
It was a real challenge and a long journey, as I was always tossing up between different pieces! It came down to selecting the items that we'd fallen in love with at first sight, and had continued to capture our attention, until they finally found their way into our home.

<h4 style="text-align: left"><strong>Do you have a favourite furniture piece from Clickon? </strong></h4>
</div>
<p style="text-align: left">Just one? That's a real challenge! If we're talking about pieces in my home, I'd have to pick between the Hold Sofa &amp; Simone Bookcase. With the Simone Bookcase, there's something so beautiful about it's design, and the idea that it's built to showcase the things you cherish. For me, this means the ability to display my plants alongside books and objects that my partner and I have collected over the years.</p>

<h4><strong>Do you ever worry about items from different brands not matching? </strong></h4>
Not really! I don't spend too much time worrying about things matching or not. If I fall in love with something, then it tends to find its way into our home. There's an eclectic mix of timbers, metallics, glass, marbles, fabrics and colours in our home. Interiors should be a reflection of who you are and what you love, so if the pieces in your space bring you joy, then you shouldn't worry too much about the timber of the dining table matching the timber on something else.

<h4><strong>What is your top tip for customers looking to furnish their home?</strong></h4>
Start with the key piece for your needs, and build out from that. I'm someone who spends a lot of time in my living room, so the couch was one of the first things that we selected and built out from that choice.
<h4><strong>Are there any other items currently on your wish list? </strong></h4>
I have a never-ending wishlist of pieces, but the top of the list is the Alva Lounge Chair from the new Sarah Ellison collection. I fell in love with it the moment I saw it, but I already have the amazing Coco Lounge Chair. Anything in the Cane Range is also high on my wishlist, especially the Cane Cabinet and Cane Lounge Chair.

<h4><strong>Can you make a mojito for me?</strong></h4>
Sure! It's pretty simple. Muddle lime wedges with brown sugar, add ice halfway and a sprinkling of mint leaves, and pour over the rum. Stir until the sugar dissolves, add more ice, top with soda water, and you're done.

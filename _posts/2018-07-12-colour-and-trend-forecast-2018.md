What is more exciting than a fresh look for your interior? That I do not know, however we have conducted research and have collated this need-to-know guide of colours and trends that you have to get on board with now!

With the new season just around the corner earthy tones with peach, apricot and dusty notes have made an appearance. These colours will look stunning partnered with neutral colours acting as a base and natural finishes such as marbles, oaks and woven rugs to truly complete the look. For a really bold statement try pairing with terrazzo or leather.

As pictured here: <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/alva-velvet-lounge-chair">The Alva Lounge Chair</a> in Rust quilted Velvet (also available in Peach), looks striking partnered with the <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/jay-coffee-table">Jay terrazzo coffee table</a> taking up centre place.

Millennial Pink has graduated into a more sophisticated note as the Pink tones stick around for yet another season. The new shades have been inspired by “Fetish Foods” as per the Pantone's Colour Institute who have predicted that colours such as spicy reds, vibrant watermelon red, sweet flamingo orange and rich purples will take centre stage in the new collection. Trends such as richly coloured furniture pieces will be seen in homes across the world in 2019. Rule of thumb: don’t be afraid of colour, when its done right it has an incredible effect on a space.

As pictured here: <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/hug-fabric-lounge-chair">The Hug Lounge chair</a> in Kit Grey from Wendelbo, The <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/jane-rug">Jane Rug</a> in Red, The <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/cane-cabinet">Cane Console</a> in Black paired with the Aquatic Canna Plant 120cm and <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/brent-rosenberg-beyond-the-truest">Brent Rosenberg’s Beyond the </a>Truest in Navy /Oak Frame.

Saturated blues are also present in the colour palettes for the next season. Whether it be a muted navy or a saturated cobalt you won't miss a beat with this colouration. Navy is a strong base that can work with a lot of different palettes and styles of interiors, it can also act as a colour that will continue from season to season almost as effective as a neutral.

As pictured here: Harto’s <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/marius-chest-of-drawers">Marius chest of drawers</a> in petrol blue is the perfect addition to any room. Balanced with the natural tones of the oak and brass hardware this piece will take you from season to season commanding the attention of everyone’s eye.

Deep emerald greens are on trend again with the only change being they will hold more of a grassy tone. These will pair back with other colours such caviar black, swan white, burgundy reds, camel and grey flannel. This classic and timeless palate is one that will never date but will acknowledge colour trends as they come and go and make your designer friends think you are an early adopter and ahead of the trends.

As Pictured here: The <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/tip-toe-bench-large">Tip Toe bench</a> upholstered in Green Velvet (Juke COLOUR:162), <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/green-home-print-2">Green Home Print 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/palm-traveller-180cm">Palm traveller 180cm</a> faux tree making an appearance in the corner.

Don’t forget when getting on board with any of these trends, add a touch of personality with greenery. Plants and trees are a great addition to any interior through any season. If you live in an apartment or a house with not enough light, don’t let this stop you. We have a whole range of plants that require no maintenance at all, maybe just a little dust every now and then. And the best part is you can purchase all of these trends listed above with us at Clickon.

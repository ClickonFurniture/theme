<p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">Earlier this month, we had the pleasure of being invited to France by Fermob to experience their manufacturing process and gain some insight into their headquarters, as well as a sneak peek at their upcoming products.</span></p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">Synonymous with joie de vivre, Fermob have been producing outdoor furniture since 1953 in Thoissey, France; a stone’s throw from Lyon. The Fermob we know and love today began with the Bistro and 1900 ranges, the latter of which has changed very little since its inception over 60 years ago. The company was taken over by current Managing Director, Bernard Reybier, in 1989, and has grown from 10 employees to over 270 today. Bernard took historical designs and reworked them into the pieces we see today through innovation, research and by partnering with designers from all over the world.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><sup>Images by Stephane Rambaud for Fermob</sup></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">A leading expert in outdoor space design, Fermob’s ever-expanding catalogue includes a wide range of furniture, homewares and lighting, perfect for use in the home or commercial environments. Starting with just Cedar Green and Cotton White, Fermob have developed over 50 colours in 30 years! Their colour chart is revised year after year by Fermob’s colour experts to make way for fresh, new colour palettes. With exciting new colours and the introduction of new materials like teak, there’s sure to be something for everybody.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">We met with Fermob’s design team at Port Rambaud in Lyon to see what’s new.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center">Cadiz Collection</h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">Combining aluminium and outdoor fabric, this collection includes 5 different seats to fit every purpose – chair, armchair, low armchair, counter stool and bar stool. Being made from aluminium, these pieces are light and easy to move, and can be stacked for easy storage. The fabric seat and backrest are comfortable and accomodating, but the real hero of this collection is the armrests. It takes no less than 17 steps to transform a straight aluminium tube into the smooth, curved armrests seen on the Cadiz. Available in Cotton White, Nutmeg, Cactus, Lagoon Blue, and Liquorice. Stay tuned!</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center">Surprising Teak Chair</h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">You know the Surprising Chair, but have you met its new cousin? Combining teak and steel, this piece is made in partnership with Vlaemynck; Fermob’s sister brand, and a trusted expert in teak furniture. The Surprising Teak Chair is sure to add some colour and warmth to your outdoor dining space.</span></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center">Mooon! Lamp</h4>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">Designed by Tristan Lohner and inspired by 19th century Parisian street lamps, Mooon! is an atmospheric addition to any space. With a choice of cool light or warm light, as well as two light intensities, Mooon! is at home indoors or outdoors.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">Our next stop was Thoissey, home to Fermob’s headquarters and factory. Over 5,000 tons of metal are produced at Fermob’s factory each year, and they manufacture 750,000 pieces each year – including over 100,000 Bistro chairs!</span></p>
<a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/brand/fermob"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1943 size-large" src="https://blog.clickonfurniture.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Fermob-Blog-Post-Pic-3-1024x651.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="413" /></a>
<p style="text-align: center"><sup>Louvre Chairs &amp; Bistro Chairs in production</sup></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">Steel and aluminium are the key materials used in Fermob’s collections. The materials are received in sheets are reels, and are transformed into colourful outdoor furniture through mechanical cutting, bending and folding. Some pieces, such as the 1900 Collection, are so intricate that they are hand-welded and crafted in Fermob’s own forge. Every step of the way, each piece is inspected to ensure it is made to last, and once finished, each piece is personally signed by its inspector before it leaves.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><sup>The making of a 1900 Low Table</sup></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center"><span class="s1">Fermob has the utmost respect for the environment, and sustainability is a key aspect of their company culture and production process. By introducing an oven-drying method for metal parts, Fermob have cut their energy consumption by 30% and reduced their paint-curing temperature by 10 degrees. All paints used are solvent-free, and applied in a zero-release facility.</span></p>

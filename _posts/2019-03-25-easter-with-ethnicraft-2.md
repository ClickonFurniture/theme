<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What was the inspiration behind the shoot. </b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our Easter with Ethnicraft shoot, <i>From the garden</i>, was inspired by the coming together of friends and family. It combines the appreciation of rich textures and the beauty from found and foraged objects. The centrepiece of the shoot, the dining setting, was created around the shared banquet style of dining, celebrating the fluidity of real life family gatherings and the often accompanying extra guest.</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Which Ethnicraft pieces are heroed this season?</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This year we have mixed classic and new styles as well as the varied timbers offered by Ethnicraft to create an Easter table that is warm and inviting. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/ethnicraft-teak-pettersson-dining-table">Teak Pettersson Dining Table</a></span> is the perfect base for our gathering, the timber polished to enhance its natural characteristics, is left otherwise raw allowing it to age beautifully with your family. Combining this table with the contemporary <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/ethnicraft-oak-facette-dining-chair"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facette Dining Chair</span></a> in black gives the setting texture and depth, while the <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/ethnicraft-oak-disc-stool"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disc Stool</span></a> allows you to easily accomodate unexpected guests.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the feast, we move into the lounge room and sink in with a second helping of chocolate. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/ethnicraft-oak-wave-tv-unit">Oak Wave TV Unit</a></span> is perfect for creating a calm and organised living space. Match this with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/spenser-rug">Spencer Rug</a></span> in grey to further draw out the warm tones of the European Oak and create a cosy place to relax for the evening. </span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What does the perfect Easter gathering entail for the Clickon Team?</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This Easter we will be spending less time on social media and more time in the garden. While it takes time to prepare for a gathering the effort is well worth it when the company arrives. The gathering itself will consist of quality fresh produce, all of the carbs and of course chocolate.</span></p>

<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What are your styling suggestions for this Easter?</b></span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have kept the accessories to a minimum to draw focus onto the furniture and of course the food. Keeping vases and serve ware in off-white tones will make them pop against the timber table and show off your kitchen creations. Hints of indigo blue in the table linen and backing board contrast against the timber while green foliage, fresh from the garden, adds texture and homeliness. </span></p>

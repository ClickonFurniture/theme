Creating the perfect backdrop for your dinner parties is made even easier when you choose to invest in an extendable table. This will help you save space for every day, keeping your home looking neat and tidy. And, when guests arrive you can pull out all the stops (and the extension leaves) to reveal a dynamic dining space that will serve you well into the night. We have put together the 5 best extendable tables by Danish brand PBJ Designhouse to achieve the ultimate dining experience no matter how many guests arrive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
<h3>Round<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></h3>
<a href="https://www.trithouse.com.au/dining/round-extendable-dining-table"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2349 size-large" src="https://blog.trithouse.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Blog-extendable-14-1024x361.jpg" alt="Round Extendable Table" width="650" height="229" data-wp-pid="2349" /></a>

The most perfect table for apartments and breakfast nooks is this Round Table. The table changes from a compact 1050 mm diameter to an oval table 1600 mm in length. We also recommend this for multi purpose rooms, as a desk, change table or even an entry table.

While many tables try hard to hide that they are extendable the bow makes a feature of the extension detail. This unique herringbone pattern creates a perfect centrepiece detail with no flowers required. We love the new black stained oak top which is now available for pre order.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

<h4><strong>Introducing Natadora</strong></h4>
<a href="https://www.trithouse.com.au/bureau-3-seater-sofa"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2218" src="https://blog.trithouse.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bureau-sofa-front1-3-958x1024.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="695" /></a>

Trit House are proud to be one of the first stockists of <a href="https://www.trithouse.com.au/brand/natadora">Natadora</a>. Like Trit House, Natadora is a family run business. With their Danish roots they effortlessly merge Scandinavian aesthetic with mid century modern design. Bringing with them many years of experience in the industry and fine craftsmanship, Natadora promise to bring us a new kind of masculinity through thoughtful, quality designs, crafted to perfection.

<h4><strong>Meet the Designer</strong></h4>
<a href="https://www.trithouse.com.au/brand/natadora"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2214" src="https://blog.trithouse.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Sonder-arbour-scribe-monday-coco.2-1024x604.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="383" /></a>

Natadora endeavour to introduce us to cutting edge designers from around the globe and turn their visions in to reality. Beginning with Cameron Foggo. Cameron Foggo is an established high end furniture designer who now calls Sydney home. From New Zealand originally, Cameron has design in his blood as his family run an Interior Design and Manufacturing Business. He did the hard yards and studied at Auckland Society of Arts and then went on to Wellington Design School before his father took him in as his protégé. Cameron’s eye for elegant, refined details and his unpretentious attitude are what make his designs the timeless masterpieces they are.

<h4><strong>Bureau</strong></h4>

The Bureau Sofa has been shortlisted to win Best Furniture Design in The Design Files 2019 Design Awards program. At first glance you may see the subtle mid century influence but look closer and be taken aback by the exquisite and refined detail that goes into this contemporary show stopper.

&nbsp;
<h4><strong>Scribe</strong></h4>

One for the lovers of Bauhaus. Scribe’s skeletal frame against its lush fabric emanates a luxurious whirlwind for the senses. Scribe can be viewed in our Abbotsford showroom today.

<h4><strong>Department</strong><a href="https://www.trithouse.com.au/department-3-seater-sofa"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2213" src="https://blog.trithouse.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/department-and-fable-window-927x1024.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="718" /></a>Like an outfit you can take from the office to the evening, Natadora’s pieces can go from Commercial fit outs to Residential projects effortlessly. The department modular sofa is a perfect example of this with the juxtaposition of its soft curves and right angles. Being modular, it can be custom made to fit any space.</h4>

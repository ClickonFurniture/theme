Introducing Clickon Furniture's Styling Consultations, a <b>FREE</b> one on one meeting with one of our stylists.

<!--more-->

Weâ€™re here to help. Our interior stylists completely understand the often-daunting task of re-decorating, renovating or styling a space. Armed with the necessary skills and knowledge to transform any space, our stylists can provide you with mood boards, ideas and a final proposal for your room transformation.

Our styling consultations allow our customers to start that initial discussion of styling a room or home with one of our showroom stylists.

The consultation will provide answers to the fundamentals of constructing a space, property styling, room makeovers, colour consulting, product suggestions, styling information and should you require, a personalised sales quote. The consultations are available at any one of our three showrooms located in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane and are by appointment only. To book a time with one of our stylists you can contact our showrooms directly or submit an appointment time online through the button below.

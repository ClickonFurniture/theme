Ultra Violet is the Pantone chosen colour for 2018. This vibrant hue is all about looking towards the future, and pushes for what is next in the world. Inspired by the stars, Ultra Violet was the chosen colour due to it's originality and ingenuity. "<em>This magical, characterful and complex hue fascinates and intrigues." - </em><a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year-2018">Pantone</a>. With purple being such a bold choice for interiors we have selected our favourite items inspired by the 2018 Pantone colour of the year.
<h4>Our Pantone Selection</h4>
The <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/georges-sofa">Georges Sofa</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.clickonfurniture.com.au/georges-armchair">Arm Chair</a>.

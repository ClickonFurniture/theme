<h4><strong>Robin's Favourite Piece</strong></h4>

The simple but stunning Ingrid Chair by Sketch captures the brands desire to create simple, functional furniture for everyday people. They aim their products at those that appreciate quality design and comfort.
<h4><strong>Future development for Sketch </strong></h4>
The brand is looking to diversify from their current Scandinavian look into a more mature direction. Focusing on items that are perhaps less colourful and playful but still created with the highest craftsmanship and comfort levels. As a brand they only create products that they would purchase themselves so there is no doubt that their future collections will be just as successful. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Watch this space</span>

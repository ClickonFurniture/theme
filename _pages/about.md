Creating this blog is a way to bring our furniture to life.Â With a focus on the home as a whole rather than any individual element, we aim to help our customers envisage how our product will work to enhance their interior.

Our blog contains a collection of interviews with our much loved brands, trends forecasting as well as tips and tricks on creating a unique look for your home. Contributed to by our talented Trit staff, our curators are influenced by art and design, craftsmanship and global trends. We believe that a home that expresses your personal point-of-view is a home that you'll love living in for a lifetime.

We encourage our customers to utilise this blog as a starting point for ideas and inspiration for your home. For further styling advice and product information please feel free to contact our showroom nationwide.
